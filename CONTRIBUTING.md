## Getting started <!-- omit in toc -->

### Don't see your issue? Open one

If you spot something new, open an issue. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### Ready to make a change? Fork the repo
First, fork this repository:

- [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

Once you're done, clone your fork locally.

### Install dependencies
Once your fork is available locally, start by installing the dependencies:

```npm install```

Thanks to the `postinstall` script, this will also install the peer dependencies of the project, which are necessary for development.

### Make your changes
Then, make changes to the files you'd like to update, then create/push commits to your fork after validating your changes locally:

```npm test```

Also, make sure that the examples are still functional.

### Open a pull request
When you're done making changes and you'd like to propose them for review, create a Pull Request (PR).

### Submit your PR & get it reviewed
Once you submit your PR, maintainers will review it with you. They may have questions and remarks about your proposed changes.

### Your PR is merged!
Congratulations! You have now contributed to this Open Source library; you're a rock star! :sparkles:
